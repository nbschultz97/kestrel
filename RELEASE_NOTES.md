# Unreleased — v0.30.0-alpha (in development)

Not published. This section tracks what is on the development branch and will
ship in the next release; there is no download for it yet. The current public
build is v0.29.1-alpha, below.

v0.30.0 is an asset release. The flight model, terrain, and OSD are unchanged;
what changed is that the aircraft you build finally looks like the parts you
picked.

### Aircraft & parts

- **169 part meshes, up from 99, and all of them textured.** Carbon weave
  oriented per part, silkscreen and components on the PCBs, anodised motor
  bells, printed battery wraps. No untextured placeholder geometry remains in
  the build catalogue.
- **Airframes calibrated against manufacturer CAD.** The TBS Source family was
  measured out of the vendor's own STEP files — plate outline, arm taper, stack
  mounting, standoff heights — and the rest of the airframe classes were scaled
  to sit correctly against them.
- **Propellers rebuilt from measurement.** Real prop geometry plus 84 product
  photos, resolved into ten planform families. Pitch and blade count are visual
  axes now, and the blades are translucent polycarbonate rather than opaque
  slabs.
- **Li-ion packs are cylinder banks, LiPo packs are bricks.** They were the same
  mesh with a different label; they are now different objects with different
  silhouettes and wraps.
- **Full antenna, VTX, camera, GPS and receiver families**, each with the
  pigtails and connectors the real part carries.
- **Showcase builds are wired end to end** — camera looms, VTX coax, receiver
  antenna tubes, and XT60s that mate to their counterpart instead of floating
  beside it.

### In flight

- **Props are visible in the FPV view.** The camera near clip was culling the
  blades out of frame; it now sits inside the disc, which restores the sweep
  across the top and bottom of the picture that defines the FPV look.
- **The fitted camera drives the flight FOV.** Choosing a narrow analog cam and
  a wide digital cam changes what you see out the front, not just the part list.
- **Prop-wash dust on takeoff** — a ring and puffs lifted off the pad, scaled by
  thrust over hover.
- **Kills swap in a wrecked airframe** rather than deleting the aircraft.
- **The HANGAR spools the props** while you build.

### World & characters

- **New pilot and twelve mission characters**, rebuilt on a corrected skeleton —
  the old rig had joint orientations that broke every pose it was given.
- **In progress, not yet landed:** a full vehicle fleet with civilian traffic,
  and mission-objective set pieces.

### Under the hood

- Part meshes re-authored and re-exported through a single generator, so the
  catalogue, the HANGAR preview, and the flight mesh all read the same source.
- Materials consolidated onto shared textured masters (weave, silkscreen,
  anodise, wrap) instead of per-part flat colours.
- Reference measurement set — vendor STEP files, prop geometry, and product
  photography — captured alongside the generator so parts can be re-derived
  rather than re-eyeballed.

# KESTREL v0.29.1-alpha

The current public release. The strike line landed after v0.29.0 was packaged,
so the working strike mission went out to nobody before this build. v0.29.1 is
the build testers actually have on disk.

For the full per-build changelog (v0.26.0 → v0.29.1, every play-test wave, every
flight-model fix), see `CHANGELOG.md` inside the zip. This file is a one-page
summary of the public-facing surface.

## What's new since the last public release

- **The strike is a one-way attack, and the pilot now flies it like one.** On the
  terminal leg the avoidance response and the AGL speed brake come off: the thing
  filling the look-ahead IS the aim point, so every avoidance reaction was a miss,
  and the brake's premise — *"this aircraft has to still be flying in two seconds"*
  — is false for a munition. Left in, the dive sat inside the floor band for its
  whole length and bled back the forward stick producing it, so the aircraft
  settled into a controlled descent and arrived at walking pace. Impact speed
  is now logged.
- **Analog FPV feed** — a 4:3 window with deterministic noise, framed last over
  everything, because an element that lands in the pillarbox was never
  transmitted on a real analog link.
- **Convoy placement that survives contact with the map** — the column was in
  the median because its heading came from OSM, and the warhead fired on a
  radius instead of on the hull.
- **A play-test wave** — nineteen reports from v0.28.3 (black inventory tiles,
  spawning underground, the 10–20 s launch freeze, black bars in fullscreen,
  the minus key eating the MGRS northing, the weather clamp, etc.). See the
  changelog for the long form.
- **Test range with user-set wind / weather / atmosphere** — controls live in
  the flight view, sliders drive the same atmosphere the physics reads.
- **New markers** (waypoints, spawn, strike) replacing the old black platforms.
- **WORK BENCH renamed to HANGAR** and reorganized.
- **Flight controller on its own 1 kHz clock** instead of the render clock, with
  per-airframe rate scaling.

## Install or update

Existing installations update automatically the next time `KESTREL.exe` is
launched. For a new installation, download `KESTREL-alpha-win64.zip`, extract it
to its own folder, and run `KESTREL.exe`.

The archive is Windows x64 and requires a discrete GPU for practical UE5
performance. This remains an alpha release; report crashes or unexpected
behavior through the repository issues page.
