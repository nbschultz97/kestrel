# KESTREL v0.29.1-alpha

The current public release. The strike line landed after v0.29.0 was packaged,
so the working strike mission went out to nobody before this build. v0.29.1 is
the build testers actually have on disk.

For the full per-build changelog (v0.26.0 → v0.29.1, every play-test wave, every
flight-model fix), see `CHANGELOG.md` inside the zip. This file is a one-page
summary of the public-facing surface.

## What's new since the last public release

- **The strike is a one-way attack, and the pilot now flies it like one.** On the
  terminal leg the avoidance response and the AGL speed brake come off: the thing
  filling the look-ahead IS the aim point, so every avoidance reaction was a miss,
  and the brake's premise — *"this aircraft has to still be flying in two seconds"*
  — is false for a munition. Left in, the dive sat inside the floor band for its
  whole length and bled back the forward stick producing it, so the aircraft
  settled into a controlled descent and arrived at walking pace. Impact speed
  is now logged.
- **Analog FPV feed** — a 4:3 window with deterministic noise, framed last over
  everything, because an element that lands in the pillarbox was never
  transmitted on a real analog link.
- **Convoy placement that survives contact with the map** — the column was in
  the median because its heading came from OSM, and the warhead fired on a
  radius instead of on the hull.
- **A play-test wave** — nineteen reports from v0.28.3 (black inventory tiles,
  spawning underground, the 10–20 s launch freeze, black bars in fullscreen,
  the minus key eating the MGRS northing, the weather clamp, etc.). See the
  changelog for the long form.
- **Test range with user-set wind / weather / atmosphere** — controls live in
  the flight view, sliders drive the same atmosphere the physics reads.
- **New markers** (waypoints, spawn, strike) replacing the old black platforms.
- **WORK BENCH renamed to HANGAR** and reorganized.
- **Flight controller on its own 1 kHz clock** instead of the render clock, with
  per-airframe rate scaling.

## Install or update

Existing installations update automatically the next time `KESTREL.exe` is
launched. For a new installation, download `KESTREL-alpha-win64.zip`, extract it
to its own folder, and run `KESTREL.exe`.

The archive is Windows x64 and requires a discrete GPU for practical UE5
performance. This remains an alpha release; report crashes or unexpected
behavior through the repository issues page.
